Compiling ezQuake sources on Windows:

requirements:
Sources are compilable in following version of Microsoft Visual Studio:
6, 7, 7.1, 8 (2005 .NET)

instructions:
1) grab source from ezquake CVS:
 - cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@ezquake.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ezquake
 - checkout module ezquake:
 - cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@ezquake.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ezquake co -P ezquake
2) get directx SDK and place it where compiler can see it
 - http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=7AB978B5-5F1A-4F6A-88EB-FC646138BECA&displaylang=en
 - project file looks in DXSDK_PATH (Environment variable), you can set this in your System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables settings
3) download all required libraries
 - go to libs/ dir and launch windows-libs-download.bat
 - perhaps you will have to rename libtcl8.4.lib to tcl84.lib and libz.lib to zlib.lib
4) open ezquake.sln for Microsoft Visual Studio 7.1 or ezquake_msvs_80.sln for MS VS 8.0 (2005 .NET)
5) select ReleaseGL configuration and press "Build"


Microsoft Visual Studio 8 and .s (asm) files
---
 - Requirements:
   There are no special requirements, we include everything in CVS, you just need cl.exe
   which is a part of MS VS 8 package
 - We use Custom Build Tool to compile asm .s files in MS VS 8.
 - Visual Studio reads all instructions from qasm.rules
 - That file is included in the project file (ezquake_msvs_80.vcproj)
 - Instructions are named 'qasm' and are applied on *.s files
 - Visual Studio 8 doesn't have ml.exe (known as masm32) so we have ml.exe in masm32 dir (binary in CVS)
 - We include gas2masm in ezquake solution
   Note: gas2masm.exe is not being re-compiled on every solution build but only when modified
 - gas2masm.exe is stored in gas2masm dir, has same name for both Release and Debug build
   Note: It's kind of 'conflict' but it doesn't matter.
   Note: gas2masm.exe is ignored and not included in CVS!
 - How custom build works:
   1) cl (optimizer), input is .s file, output is .spp (optimized) file
   2) gas2masm, input is .spp file, output is .asm file
   3) ml, input .asm file, output is .obj file
   4) intermediate .spp and .asm files are deleted
   5) .obj file is then used by the linker
 - Current state: masm32 (ml.exe) gives error for me: Debug-gl\sv_math.asm(445) : error A2006:  : _BOPS_Error
